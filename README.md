This GitHub repository is being created to make publically available data sources of interest for projects I am working on. 

The Clustering of Fata Traffic Collisions on I-5 in 2016 shows the separation, in miles (assuming 1 degree latitude = 60.5 miles) between collisions at successive lattitudes, up to 1-mile separation. Lattitude was chosen to allow continuity accross state lines. There are obvious clusters representing LA and Seattle. This data will be compared with similar N-S Interstates.

The NationalCSV datasets are being examined. The accident.csv files specifically have the data I am looking at.
